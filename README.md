# Purpose/Problem Statement 
The issue this program solves is the lack of organization and transparency in task delegation within teams, leading to confusion, missed deadlines,   and inefficient collaboration.

# Target Audience 
This program aims to benefit teams who may suffer from confusion over task responsibility, missed deadlines and other issues stemming from a lack of team management
  
# Solution + Limitations 
this program allows users to create tasks, and assign them to group members, in order to organize workflow, improving team collaboration and task management efficiency.
  
# Key Features / Key Components 
The core feature of this program is the function to create and assign tasks to members of a team, enhancing collaboration and task management efficiency
  
# Technical Challenges + Future Plans 
One issue I faced during the development of this program was replacing strings from lists using the replace method. Instead, I used list methods to insert new elements, and delete the old ones from the lists. It would be possible to implement a feature that would force the user to continue entering input until it is an option that the program accepts
  
# Project Timeline 
The first few days were to map out how I would want the program to run which included thinking about the variables I would need, how to show and update the status of a task, etc. After that process, I spent the rest of the days coding and debugging the program.
